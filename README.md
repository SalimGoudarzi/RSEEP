Steps to run the model: -First make sure you download the latet release: click on the green "<> code" button and press "Download ZIP". 
-Download the "RSEEP.zip" and unzip it. 
-Open "RSEEP" and unzip "DATA.zip".
-Note that this will create a path with double DATA folders: ...\DATA\DATA... 
-You will need to copy-paste the contents of the 2nd DATA folder into the 1st DATA folder and then remove the 2nd DATA folder. 
-Once you are done unziping, open and run "RSEEP_run.m".
-Model equations are implemented in RSEEP_ode.
-Model details are available in this journal article: Coupled water-carbon modelling in data-limited sites: a new approach to explore future agroforestry scenarios (J. Biogeosciences).
